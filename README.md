# AAA-Hosting-Services
We had to develop a website using Liferay for Triple-A (AAA) company which is a web host solutions service company located in downtown of Myanmar. t provides all types of services which include domain name registration, Shared Hosting, Reseller Hosting, Cloud Hosting, VPS Hosting, Dedicated Hosting, and Colocation service, etc.

## Project Backgorund
Customers can purchase their services from AAA’s branch offices and needs to provide personal
information such as name, email, address, national identity card number and contact number.

Customers' data is a very important factor for AAA Company. To maintain and manage all of their
customer information, AAA has been decided to develop an application with an object-oriented
approach.
An application is required to keep track of their customer’sinfo and services given to customers. The
well-organized customer data can help the company to select the correct recipients for promotions
and new services.
The Scope of the Project is to build a Liferay Framework website with customer’s data management
application.
